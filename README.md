# Stable-diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image model that generates photo-realistic images from text input. With autonomous creativity and incredible speed, it empowers users to create stunning art in seconds.

NOTE: It may take some time for the Installation on first time! ⚠️

- Lightning-fast performance for seamless art creation.
- Access to advanced computational resources, including GPUs andpy  TPUs by Google Colbatory.
- Unlimited image generation for Free!

## First Method!
1. Access Google Colab: Visit <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15xE2n24B1UZfsIzfnNSCyh6rYr_AKWtb?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Colab</a> to get started with Kandinsky-V2.
2. To Ensure Proper Execution, run each Colab cell starting from the beginning.
3. In the third cell, enter the input you want to generate, and then press Enter to proceed.
4. To retrieve the captivating images generated by Kandinsky-V2, simply run the Fourth cell!

## Second Method!
1. Access Google Colab: Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new Colab notebook.
3. Copy this Code Given Below and Execute the Cell!

```python
!nvidia-smi
```

4. After sucessfully executing run this:

```python
!pip install diffusers==0.11.1
!pip install transformers scipy ftfy accelerate
```

5. After sucessfully executing run this:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```

6. After sucessfully executing run this:
   
```python
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
```

7. After sucessfully executing run this:

```python
prompt = input("Enter your input: ")
negative_prompt = "out of frame, lowres, text, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, out of frame, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  # image here is in [PIL format](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

# Saving the Generated Image
image.save(f"out.png")


# To Display the Image
image
```

8. To generate additional variations, use a different seed with the same image.

```python
import torch

generator = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(1024)       # Same image with different Seed to generate more diferrent

image = pipe(prompt, generator=generator).images[0]

image
```


9. To introduce randomness and generate more diverse results, you can add a random number as interference.

```python
import torch

generator = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(1024)

image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=50, generator=generator).images[0]   

image
```

10. To create a grid of images, you can use the following code give below:
    
```python
from PIL import Image

def image_grid(imgs, rows, cols):
    assert len(imgs) == rows*cols

    w, h = imgs[0].size
    grid = Image.new('RGB', size=(cols*w, rows*h))
    grid_w, grid_h = grid.size
    
    for i, img in enumerate(imgs):
        grid.paste(img, box=(i%cols*w, i//cols*h))
    return grid
```

Then Run this to generate the output in Columns and Rows (May take sometime)
    
```python
num_images = 3
input= input("Enter Your Input :")
prompt = [input] * num_images

images = pipe(prompt).images

grid = image_grid(images, rows=1, cols=3)
grid
```

here's how to generate a grid of `n × m` images

```python

```
